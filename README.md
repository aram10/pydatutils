# pydatutils

A suite of tools for parsing and writing GameCube .DAT files containing model and animation data, predominantly from `Pokémon Colosseum` and `Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness`. The purpose of this package is to modularize the utilities in Stars Momodu's Blender addon for importing GameCube models (https://github.com/StarsMmd/Blender-Addon-Gamecube-Models), to support the development of a tool for exporting Blender models to .DAT files.
